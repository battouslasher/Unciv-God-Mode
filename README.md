# GOD MODE by battouslasher
WARNING: This is a CHEAT SYSTEM and will SEVERELY UNBALANCE your game! Based on Tonedome's mod, "UncivCheatMeun" (I'm sure he messed up "menu" at the end of that).

Tested with UNCIV: Civ V - Vanilla and Civ V - Gods & Kings in both PC and Android versions. It should work with any ruleset that uses the standard "ancient era" set of techs. I WILL NOT be making another version of this mod. I made this purely for my own entertainment and decided to share it with the rest of you.

To use, install the mod and select it when starting a game. Play the game as normal and build your capital. You should see a National Wonder in the list of buildable buildings called "Divine Gate". Switch your production from Monument to "Divine Gate". In ONE turn, the entire map will reveal immediately and enable other buildings associated with specific cheats in your capital city. If there's a cheat you don't want to use, simply don't build the building. The cheats associated with a specific building can be seen at the bottom-right corner of the city screen where you select a building or unit for production.

Originally, this cheat had a unit that you needed to consume to get a free tech point that you'll need to spend for a "God Mode" or "Cheat Menu" tech that enables the buildings in your production. I simplified that by skipping the messing of the tech tree altogether. Technically, this is like the 5th or 6th version of this mod with many different flavor texts and unit models and icons I created myself and eventually, I grew tired of the hassle and condensed everything into this version now. I am releasing this as version 1.0 and is the final version.

This cheat was designed this way in order for it to be useable on Unciv for Android since we can't use trainers or the Cheat Engine on it. If it were just for the PC, I wouldn't have had the need to make this.

Finally, this is my very first mod of any game in the 40+ years I've been a gamer and programmer. No need for stars and all that. If you want it, use it. If not, you are free to ignore it. The world should be free like that.
