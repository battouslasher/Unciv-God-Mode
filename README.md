# GOD MODE v1.3.240908 by battouslasher
WARNING: This is a CHEAT SYSTEM and will SEVERELY UNBALANCE your game! This mod was inspired by Tonedome's mod, "UncivCheatMeun" (I'm sure he messed up "menu" at the end of that).

This mod works ONLY with UNCIV's Civ V - Vanilla OR Civ V - Gods & Kings in both PC and Android platforms. I won't be making mods for other rulesets I don't play.

NOTE UPDATE 2024-09-14: This is just a README update to inform you guys of something I found out just a few minutes ago. This mod was designed in a way that it can only be accessed by a human player. However, after exhaustively playing it for days, I noticed something. The first time, I thought it was a fluke. The second time, I was having doubts. But now, I am sure - for some reason, the AI CAN USE the mod. I was so surprised when I came face to face with a unit that was boosted by one of my cheat buildings. No matter how much I trace back, there is only ONE possibility - the AI got a free tech upgrade point and used it to activate God Mode in the Research Tech Tree so it didn't really need the Angel unit. While it doesn't always happen, it does happen. I will try to figure something out to prevent this in a future update.

# CHANGELOG:
UPDATE 2024-09-08 (v.1.30): Moved the REVEAL MAP function into the "God Mode" tech instead of waiting for the Divine Gate to be built in the capital. I decided to do this so you can properly position your capital. You will still need to build the Divine Gate to access the rest of the other cheats but it will currently have no other purpose since it used to be the reveal map cheat. All this will still happen within your first turn.

UPDATE 2024-09-06 (v.1.21): Changed the json code a little to try and clean up the build list. The "cheat buildings" should not appear in cities that isn't the capital so I added a few conditionals.

UPDATE 2024-09-03 (v.1.20): Added a new set of cheats to COMPLETELY RUSH the entire tech tree by era. The mod will detect if you are using Vanilla or Gods & Kings and will apply the appropriate cheats. They will require a "previous era" cheat to be built/activated. The new cheats are all using the default icon; did not create icons for the new ones yet since I am still testing them thoroughly.

UPDATE 2024-09-01 (v.1.10): So, I messed up version 1.0. After a few dozen games, I realized I had made a mistake. I guess the original idea from Tonedome was the best move because my simplification allowed the AI to build the Divine Gate as well and use God Mode. So, I have updated this mod to version 1.01 and put the Angel unit back which only the player gets as a bonus unit. This way, the AI will never be able to build the Divine Gate unless I am overlooking something again.

# USAGE:
1) Install the mod and select it when starting a game.
2) BEFORE you build your capital, select the Angel unit (it spawns with your Settler and Warrior units) and consume it to gain 1 free tech point.
3) IMMEDIATELY "pick a tech" and select "God Mode" that you find below Agriculture. The map will be revealed.
4) Play the game as normal and build your capital where you want. You should see a National Wonder in the list of buildable buildings called "Divine Gate".
5) Switch your production from Monument to "Divine Gate". All of this should happen within your first turn, and in ending that ONE turn, it will enable other buildings associated with specific cheats in your capital city.
6) If there's a cheat you don't want to use, simply don't build the building. The cheats associated with a specific building can be seen at the bottom-right corner of the city screen where you select a building or unit for production.

This cheat was designed this way in order for it to be useable on Unciv for Android since we can't use trainers or the Cheat Engine on it. If it were just for the PC, I wouldn't have had the need to make this.

Finally, this is my very first mod of any game in the 40+ years I've been a gamer and programmer. No need for stars and all that. If you want it, use it. If not, you are free to ignore it. The world should be free like that.
