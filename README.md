# GOD MODE v1.2.240903 by battouslasher
WARNING: This is a CHEAT SYSTEM and will SEVERELY UNBALANCE your game! Based on Tonedome's mod, "UncivCheatMeun" (I'm sure he messed up "menu" at the end of that).

Works ONLY with UNCIV: Civ V - Vanilla and Civ V - Gods & Kings in both PC and Android versions. I won't be making mods for other rulesets I don't play.

NOTE: Due to the method the mods are parsed into the game, it can't comprehend the logic when starting a game and will issue warnings. You can IGNORE these warnings. The mod will work just fine. Also, I did not add new graphics for the new cheats I added.

# CHANGELOG:
UPDATE 2024-09-03: Added a new set of cheats to COMPLETELY RUSH the entire tech tree by era. The mod will detect if you are using Vanilla or Gods & Kings and will apply the appropriate cheats. They will require a "previous era" cheat to be built/activated.

UPDATE 2024-09-01: So, I messed up version 1.0. After a few dozen games, I realized I had made a mistake. I guess the original idea from Tonedome was the best move because my simplification allowed the AI to build the Divine Gate as well and use God Mode. So, I have updated this mod to version 1.01 and put the Angel unit back which only the player gets as a bonus unit. This way, the AI will never be able to build the Divine Gate unless I am overlooking something again.

# USAGE:
Install the mod and select it when starting a game. BEFORE you build your capital, select the Angel unit (it spawns with your Settler and Warrior units) and consume it to gain 1 free tech point. IMMEDIATELY pick a tech and select "God Mode" that you find below Agriculture. Play the game as normal and build your capital. You should see a National Wonder in the list of buildable buildings called "Divine Gate". Switch your production from Monument to "Divine Gate". All of this should happen within your first turn, and in ending that ONE turn, the entire map will reveal immediately and enable other buildings associated with specific cheats in your capital city. If there's a cheat you don't want to use, simply don't build the building. The cheats associated with a specific building can be seen at the bottom-right corner of the city screen where you select a building or unit for production.

This cheat was designed this way in order for it to be useable on Unciv for Android since we can't use trainers or the Cheat Engine on it. If it were just for the PC, I wouldn't have had the need to make this.

Finally, this is my very first mod of any game in the 40+ years I've been a gamer and programmer. No need for stars and all that. If you want it, use it. If not, you are free to ignore it. The world should be free like that.
